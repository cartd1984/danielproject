Daniel Carter's Web Development Project

My project is about speakeasies. It has a total of three pages: speakeasyhome.html, speakeasy1920.html, and speakeasy2010.html. 

To access all 3 pages, you MUST start from speakeasyhome.html. To access speakeasy1920.html, you will click on the image below "Door 1", and to access speakeasy2010.html, you will click on the image below "Door 2".

After you click on either Door, you will be prompted to answer questions and guess the password. Once you guess the password, you will be able to access page that matches the image you clicked. So, if you clicked on the image below Door 1 and guessed the password, you will go to the speakeasy 1920.html page, and if you clicked on the image below Door 2 and guessed the password, you will be able to go in to speakeasy2010.html page.

You will have 3 tries to guess the password. If you still don't get it after the third try, you will still be able to access the page.
