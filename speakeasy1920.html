    <h2>I'm trying to figure out what to put in this webpage.</h2>
    <h3>Maybe some ideas about writing. Things I would like to write. A writing library.</h3>
    <h4>Maybe something that's dedicated to history and prohibition, something like that.</h4>
    <h5>Something like is 1920 like 2020? maybe pick some things and features of 1920 and 2020? </h5>
    <h6>a Speakeasy website</h6>
      
      <p>
      Speakeasies were very popular and flourished during the 1920s, some of the more famous speakeasies are included below. (images of "The Puncheon Club", "The '21' Club" "300 Club" "El Fey").

      <p> I think I'm going to have my project be about Speakeasies, from the past to the present, focusing on the speakeasies of the 1920s and the speakeasies of today, with a focus on Louisville, Kentucky. Have images of flappers, liquor, venues of speakeasies for Louisville from the 1920s and today; I think I also want to have pictures of liquors, have examples of popular speakeasy drinks, both then and now, and I'll have to think of interactive images, maybe like a speakeasy door to enter into speakeasies of the 1920s and now, not sure what I can do with JavaScript and JQuery on this, but thank goodness I finally have an idea.

      I also need to figure out how to push this to Git and Github, and I have no idea of how to do that, I also like the idea of creating a project list in Github to have a checklist for the project. Yes yes yes!!!!!!
