		              <p> The history of speakeasies. Speakeasies rose to prominence during the Prohibition era, in response to the nationwide ban on alcohol. Below are some examples of speakeasies. Now, they are more commonly referred to as "retro bars", which I have in another page. Alleged to have started in a saloon in Pennsylvania, where the owner asked rowdy customers to "speak easy", to avoid any trouble from law enforcement. Also known as "blind pigs" or "blind tigers" where illegal bar owners (owners of illegal establishments?) where they would showcase wild animals to circumvent the law. "Didn't take much more than a bottle and two chairs" to start a speakeasy.</p>

		          <p> I think I'm going to have my project be about Speakeasies, from the past to the present, focusing on the speakeasies of the 1920s and the speakeasies of today, with a focus on Louisville, Kentucky. Have images of flappers, liquor, venues of speakeasies for Louisville from the 1920s and today; I think I also want to have pictures of liquors, have examples of popular speakeasy drinks, both then and now, and I'll have to think of interactive images, maybe like a speakeasy door to enter into speakeasies of the 1920s and now, not sure what I can do with JavaScript and JQuery on this, but thank goodness I finally have an idea. </p>

				    <p>I also need to figure out how to push this to Git and Github, and I have no idea of how to do that, I also like the idea of creating a project list in Github to have a checklist for the project. Yes yes yes!!!!!!</p>
