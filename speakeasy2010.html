    <h1>MODERN SPEAKEASY PAGE</h1>
      
     
     
    <h2>Trying to figure out what to put in this webpage.</h2>
    <h3>Maybe some ideas about writing. I would like to write. A writing library.</h3>
    <h4>Maybe something dedicated to history and prohibition, something like that.</h4>
    <h5>Something like is 1920 like 2020? maybe pick some things and features of 1920 and 2020.</h5>
    <h6>a Speakeasy website</h6>
      
      <p>
      Modern, 21st century speakeasies are back and in full force! Here are some examples of speakeasies for the 21st century. Bringing retro back!
          (Speakeasies in New York, Chicago, Louisville, Nashville, Atlanta, Kansas City, Washington, D.C.).

      <p> I think I'm going to have my project be about Speakeasies, from the past to the present, focusing on the speakeasies of the 1920s and the speakeasies of today, with a focus on Louisville, Kentucky. Have images of flappers, liquor, venues of speakeasies for Louisville from the 1920s and today; I think I also want to have pictures of liquors, have examples of popular speakeasy drinks, both then and now, and I'll have to think of interactive images, maybe like a speakeasy door to enter into speakeasies of the 1920s and now, not sure what I can do with JavaScript and JQuery on this, but thank goodness I finally have an idea.

      I also need to figure out how to push this to Git and Github, and I have no idea of how to do that, I also like the idea of creating a project list in Github to have a checklist for the project. Yes yes yes!!!!!!
